## Dataset Availability  
The anonymized multi-view ultrasound-CT paired dataset supporting this work has been released on **Zenodo**.  

- **Link**: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15479554](https://goo.su/C0fb1)  
- The dataset includes:  
  - 50 anonymized patient cases with multi-view US images (256×256 pixels, PNG format) and corresponding CT scans (1mm³ isotropic, NIfTI).  


## Code Availability  
We are currently organizing the source code for the UltraTwin framework and will upload it to this repository **as soon as it is ready for public release**.  

- **Planned Content**:  
  - Training scripts for 3D cardiac model reconstruction from multi-view US images.  
  - Model architectures, preprocessing pipelines, and evaluation metrics.  
  - Example notebooks demonstrating dataset usage and inference.  
- **Stay Tuned**:  
  Follow this repository or check the [Zenodo dataset page](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15479554) for updates. We will announce the code release via a GitHub tag and dataset update.
